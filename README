Any List is a basic android list application that facilitates
creation of new lists and adding elements to each list.

The specialities include the ease of use like one touch add, swipe
to delete, natural flow animation, long press modify etc.

The lists are stored in a sqlite database which makes it very robust,
easy to maintain and retrieve the lists.

The swipe to dismiss feature was taken from the open source implementation
by Roman Nurik from the following repository.
"https://github.com/romannurik/Android-SwipeToDismiss".

The sqlite implementation was developed based on the tutorial by Ravi Tamada
from the following link.
